## Project Description

This project is a simple, console-based version of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors". The user plays against the computer, which makes random choices. The game is played in rounds, and the player who wins the most rounds wins the game. The game can be easily exited at any time.

The project is part of The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum, and it serves as a practical exercise for learning JavaScript fundamentals, including functions, loops, and conditionals, as well as getting familiar with user input and simple algorithms.

## Knowledge and Skills Acquired

Through this project, I deepened my understanding of several key JavaScript concepts:

- **Functions:** This project involves defining and calling several functions, allowing me to practice breaking down a problem into smaller parts that can each be addressed with a function.

- **Loops and conditionals:** Utilized loops for game rounds and conditionals for determining outcomes, refining my control flow proficiency.

- **User input:** Practiced capturing and handling user input in various formats.

- **Algorithmic thinking:** Determining the winner of a round involved creating a simple algorithm. This helped me practice thinking in terms of steps and conditions.

- **Code organization:** I learned the importance of organizing code into functions for readability and maintainability.

This project has been a great opportunity to apply and practice my JavaScript skills.
