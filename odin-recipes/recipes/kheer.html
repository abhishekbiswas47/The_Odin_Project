    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Kheer is a creamy and aromatic rice pudding that is commonly made in Indian households during festivals and special occasions. 
        The rice is cooked in milk until it becomes soft and the mixture thickens to a rich and creamy consistency. 
        The addition of sugar, nuts, and aromatic spices like cardamom adds a delightful flavor to this comforting dessert. 
        Whether enjoyed warm or chilled, Kheer is a beloved sweet treat that brings joy to every bite.
