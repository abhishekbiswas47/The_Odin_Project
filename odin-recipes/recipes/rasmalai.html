    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>4 cups milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup condensed milk</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cardamom powder</li>
        <li>Saffron strands (optional)</li>
        <li>Chopped nuts for garnish (pistachios, almonds)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a large pot, bring 2 cups of milk to a boil. 
            Once it boils, remove from heat and add lemon juice. 
            Stir gently until the milk curdles and the whey separates from the solids.
        </li>
        <li>Pour the curdled milk into a cheesecloth-lined sieve or muslin cloth. Rinse it under cold water to remove any lemony flavor.</li>
        <li>Squeeze out the excess water from the cheese cloth and hang it for 30 minutes to drain any remaining whey.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a separate pot, bring water and sugar to a boil to make the sugar syrup.</li>
        <li>
            Once the sugar syrup is ready, gently drop the cheese balls (paneer) into the boiling syrup. 
            Cover and cook for about 10 minutes on medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            In another pan, heat 4 cups of milk and bring it to a simmer. 
            Add condensed milk, cardamom powder, and saffron strands (if using). 
            Stir well and simmer for 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the cooked paneer balls from the sugar syrup and gently squeeze out any excess syrup.</li>
        <li>Transfer the paneer balls (rasgullas) to the simmering milk mixture (rabri) and cook for another 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and let it cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Garnish with chopped nuts and refrigerate for a few hours before serving.</li>
