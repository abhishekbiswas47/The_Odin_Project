    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Gulab Jamun is a classic Indian dessert that's loved by people all over the world. 
        These soft and spongy balls of goodness are soaked in a sweet syrup flavored with cardamom and saffron, making them a perfect treat for any occasion. 
        The dough is made with milk powder, flour, and baking soda, and is kneaded with ghee and milk until it's smooth and pliable. 
        The syrup, on the other hand, is made by simmering sugar, water, and spices until it thickens to a rich consistency. 
        When the Gulab Jamuns are fried and then soaked in the syrup, they absorb all the sweet goodness and become incredibly flavorful. 
        They're perfect as a dessert after a spicy Indian meal or as a sweet snack to satisfy your sweet tooth cravings.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup milk powder</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>2 tbsp ghee</li>
        <li>1/4 cup milk (or more as needed)</li>
        <li>Oil or ghee for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the syrup:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cardamom powder</li>
        <li>Saffron strands (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the milk powder, all-purpose flour, and baking soda. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Add the ghee and mix with your fingertips until the mixture looks like breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Add milk little by little and knead until you get a soft and smooth dough. The dough should be firm but not dry.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough and let it rest for 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a separate pan, prepare the syrup by adding sugar, water, cardamom powder, and saffron strands (if using). Cook on medium heat until the sugar dissolves completely and the syrup thickens slightly. Turn off the heat and keep the syrup aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil or ghee in a deep pan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into equal-sized balls, about 1 inch in diameter. Make sure there are no cracks in the balls.</li>
        <li>Once the oil is hot, add the balls to the pan, a few at a time. Fry them on low to medium heat, stirring occasionally, until they turn golden brown in color. Be careful not to overcrowd the pan.</li>
        <li>Once the Gulab Jamuns are fried, remove them from the oil with a slotted spoon and place them on a paper towel to remove excess oil.</li>
        <li>Add the fried Gulab Jamuns to the warm syrup and let them soak for at least 20-30 minutes before serving. You can also serve them with some chopped nuts as garnish.</li>
    </ol>
